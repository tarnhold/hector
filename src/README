The Makefile is the one I use on my Macbook. I use Homebrew. Note that this
installs 'casks'. The version is hard coded in the Makefile (see 0.3.13 below)
and this is something to watch out for when you try to compile the code.

Once you have homebrew and Xcode, install some packages:

brew install fftw boost openblas libomp

The correct flags are:

VERSION=1.9

CPP      = g++
CPPFLAGS = -O2 -Xpreprocessor -fopenmp -std=c++1z 
INC_DIR  = -I/usr/include/openblas/ -I/usr/local/Cellar/openblas/0.3.13/include/
PREFIX   =/usr/local
OPENBLAS = -lopenblas
LIB_DIR  = -L/usr//local/Cellar/openblas/0.3.13/lib/ -lomp
FFTW     = -lfftw3
